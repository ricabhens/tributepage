        <p id="info-1"> <span class="name"><strong>Sebastian Michaelis</strong></span> <span class="info">(セバスチャン・ミカエリス, Sebasuchan Mikaerisu)</span> is the demon butler and a senior staff member of the Phantomhive household.</p>
        <p id="info-2"><span class="age"><strong>His AGE is a SECRET,</strong></span> Because he has been around for centuries, no one knows his age. Even Yana Toboso, the author of the series, wrote in the volume one extras that Sebastian's age is a secret. He takes on the appearance of a tall and handsome adult, presumably to have others lower their guards.</p>
        <p id="info-3"><span class="home"><strong>Sebastian's real home</strong></span> is in an alternate world that is quite different from the human world. In particular, he mentioned that the creatures kept as pets there are in no way comparable to cats. Furthermore, Sebastian existed for a rather long period of time, and therefore, he occasionally muses that Ciel Phantomhive's life in comparison would feel like an instant.</p>

        <h2 class="personality">Personality</h2>
          <p><span class="seb"><strong>Sebastian</strong></span> is devoted to Ciel Phantomhive. He faithfully carries out every one of Ciel's orders while ensuring that the Phantomhive household runs smoothly as the head butler. He does not sleep—demons deem sleep a luxury—and often spends his nights fulfilling his duties. He is sometimes critical of his master and how he treats his workers, but once admitted that he is not averse to the butler lifestyle despite the concomitant daily troubles. One of his quirks is that he always responds to Ciel's orders with the saying "Yes, my lord. (御意イエス ご主人様マイロード )"</p></div>

        <h2 class="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p id="info-4">In <span class="year"><strong>January 1886,</strong> </span>Sebastian was summoned to Ciel Phantomhive when the latter's twin brother was sacrificed in a cult's summoning ritual at a cathedral. After convincing Ciel to form a contract with him and placing the seal on Ciel's right eye, Ciel ordered him to slay the cultists. Sebastian decided to adopt a "role that is best fit to serve an Earl." Therefore, he assumed the form of a butler until Ciel completes his personal mission of revenge—that is the substance of their contract. In return, Sebastian will receive Ciel's soul. He was then given the name "Sebastian" by Ciel, which used to be his dog's name, for the duration of his duties as Ciel's butler.</p>
        <p id="info-5"><span class="ciel"><strong>Ciel and Sebastian</strong></span> then began daily life. He taught Ciel the fundamentals of being an earl; Ciel, in turn, taught him how a butler fit for the Phantomhive household should act. Sebastian also learned how to properly cope with Ciel's spoiled behavior; from time to time, he had to discipline Ciel. He later attended Ciel's coronation as the Earl of Phantomhive, but he did not observe at a close distance because he saw himself as a mere butler, not family. While they were walking, Sebastian asked Ciel if he was happy with how things were. Seeing Ciel's hesitation, he attempted to devour him. He stopped, however, when Ciel suddenly turned around and stated that he was determined to attain his revenge. He commanded Sebastian to be his sword and shield and bring him victory. Sebastian complied, as he was sure that the added pain that would come with the road to Ciel's revenge would make his soul "extremely delicious."</p>
